# Lmul

Implementation of the $\mathcal{L}$-mul kernel from the paper: [Addition is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00907v2)

Benchmarking on Nvidia rtx3090 driver 535.183, CUDA version 12.2, Ubuntu 12.2.

Check out the tutorial for an in depth overview of the method introduced in the paper

## Setup
